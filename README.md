user story
As a registered user, I want to be able to reset my password, so that I can regain access to my account if I forget my password.

This user story describes the need of a registered user to reset their password and the benefit they will get from being able to do so. The user story does not specify how the password reset functionality will be implemented, which allows the development-team to come up with a solution that meets the user's needs. The product owner can then prioritize the user stories based on their business value and importance to the user.
